# Introduction

## Our data dilemma

Our most precious **memories and vital information** no longer rest safely in photo albums, attics, or filing cabinets. Instead, they **are scattered across the sprawling datacenters** of tech giants‚Äîour family photos, financial records, cherished music, and personal documents, entrusted to corporations like Apple and Google. These companies don‚Äôt just act as custodians; **they commodify our digital lives**, transforming our private moments into data streams that **fuel their profit machines**. They hold the keys to our digital existence, deciding who can access what, and when, all while **monetizing our trust**. But this isn‚Äôt their story to tell. It‚Äôs time we reclaim the narrative. **It‚Äôs time we take back control of what is rightfully ours: our data.**

## DASSET for Data Hub

<img src={require("./dasset-data-hub.png").default} />

**DASSET** is a next-generation **smart personal data hub** that gives you the convenience of the cloud **without handing your data to third parties.** Unlike traditional cloud services where your files reside on someone else‚Äôs server, DASSET runs on hardware **you own**, such as a home NAS device or small server‚Äã. This means you **keep full control of your data** at all times ‚Äì your photos, documents, and backups stay with you, protected and private. Yet, you still enjoy **cloud-like accessibility**: you can reach your files from anywhere via apps or web, auto-sync across your devices, and even opt for encrypted cloud backup on your terms‚Äã.

## What DASSET does for you

### Complete Privacy & Data Ownership
With DASSET, you are the sole owner of your information. Your files aren‚Äôt stored in big data centers where companies might scan or data-mine them‚Äã. All data stays on your device, and powerful encryption (AES-256) secures your content at rest and in transit‚Äã. In essence, your personal data remains truly private ‚Äì no prying eyes, no unwelcome surprises.

### Security and Peace of Mind
DASSET is built with a privacy-first security model. Your hub uses robust encryption (the same standard banks use) and the latest secure protocols to fend off threats‚Äã. Since your data isn‚Äôt concentrated in a big cloud server (a common target for hackers), the risk of mass data breaches is greatly reduced. You decide what gets shared and what stays completely offline, giving you peace of mind that sensitive documents or family videos never leave your possession without consent.

### Cloud Convenience, No Cloud Costs
Enjoy the ease of access of cloud storage without the ongoing fees or bandwidth costs. There are no monthly subscriptions required to use DASSET ‚Äì it‚Äôs your hardware, so you‚Äôre not renting space from a provider‚Äã. Whether you‚Äôre at home or traveling, you can instantly get to your files. Even if your internet is down, you can still access everything over your local network at full speed. DASSET also offers optional cloud backup or remote relay features if you choose, but nothing is mandatory ‚Äì it‚Äôs all under your control.

### Smart Organization & Search
Say goodbye to endless manual sorting. DASSET has built-in AI (running locally for privacy) that can automatically organize your data. For example, it can tag and categorize your photos by who‚Äôs in them, where they were taken, or events ‚Äì all without sending images to any external cloud‚Äã. You can then search your collection in natural language (e.g. ‚Äúshow my beach trip photos from last summer‚Äù) and get results instantly‚Äã. Important documents can be auto-categorized (receipts, passports, tax forms, etc.), and you can even ask your personal DASSET assistant to find a file by description. It‚Äôs like having your own private AI librarian, making sense of your files while keeping your data safe.

### Easy to Set Up & Use
You don‚Äôt need to be tech-savvy to use DASSET. It‚Äôs designed for quick, plug-and-play setup ‚Äì most users can get it running in under 15 minutes‚Äã. There‚Äôs no complex networking or coding required: a guided installation and even a QR-code mobile setup take care of the heavy lifting‚Äã. Once running, DASSET‚Äôs interface is clean and intuitive‚Äã, whether you access it from your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Backups and sync happen automatically in the background, and you can easily share files or folders with family and colleagues via simple links. In short, it‚Äôs a user-friendly experience ‚Äì all the good parts of the cloud, minus the cloud hassles.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Automated backup & sync

DASSET supports multiple ways to get your data together on the Data Hub.  Whether you want to move your data from another location to your Data Hub, or synchronize the data, keeping both copies up to date, DASSET has you covered.

#### Cloud Sync

The following clouds are currently available to synchronize your data with your DASSET Data Hub:

1. Google Drive
2. Microsoft OneDrive
3. Dropbox

<p align="center">
<img src={require("./cloud-sync.gif").default} style={{transform:'scale(1.0)'}} />
</p>

:::info

Additional cloud services will be available for Cloud Sync as support becomes available from the cloud vendors.

:::

During the set-up of your DASSET Data Hub, you are given the option to connect to the above cloud solutions and configure a synchronization policy for the synchronization.  You can choose a one-way synchronization, which copies data from either the cloud to your Data Hub, or vice-versa or you can choose a bi-directional copy, keeping both locations synced.  Additionally, during the configuration process, you can choose a schedule for how often you want to have the synchronization occur.  

#### Device back up

In addition to synchronizing your clouds, any device running the DASSET client application can also have it's data synchronized to the Data Hub.  For example, you can easily ensure all of the pictures and videos on your smartphone are automatically backed-up on the Data Hub.  

The DASSET client application is available on the following platforms:

* ![Android](android16x16.png)  Android (coming soon)
* ![iOS](ios16x16.png)  iOS (coming soon)
* ![Windows](windows16x16.png)  Windows (coming soon)
* ![MacOS](macos16x16.png)  MacOS (coming soon)

Devices such as USB hard drives, SSDs or thumbdrives can also connect directly to the Data Hub, where you can copy your data between the two with ease.

### üîç Intelligent search and retrieval

Having all of your data in one location isn't all that useful unless you can easily find it.  The built-in intelligent search in DASSET uses AI to help easily find what you're looking for, regardless of where it's stored on your Data Hub.  

### üñºÔ∏è Smart photo management

There are over 5 trillion digital photos in existence.  Since the introduction of smartphones with built-in cameras that continue to improve every year, we take lots of photos with little thought of how we're going to consume and manage the digital trove of memories we've collected.

Simply storing your digital photos on the Data Hub isn't enough by itself.  Included with DASSET is the AI Photos application, which enables you to view, edit, categorize and tag your photos.  Some of the specific capabilities are as follows:

* Automatic grouping of photos of the same person for face-tagging.
* The ability to detect scenery, such as mountains or oceans, automatically tagging your photos for easy searching.
* A map view of the locations of groupings of photos based on the GPS data encoded in the EXIF metadata of the picture for easily finding that family vacation to Cambodia.

As we continue to add features to DASSET, the inclusion of additional AI capabilities will be coming such as photo correction, natural language search and more.

### üéÅ Securely share with anyone

The ability to share your memories and information with others is a core tenet of DASSET, while ensuring you have control over how your data is shared.  DASSET provides multiple ways to share with others, offering flexibility so you can share on your terms.

####  Spaces

The DASSET client application gives you "Spaces" to determine what data you want to share, or collaborate, with others.  You can invite others to access your DASSET-powered Data Hub, which gives them the ability to store and share their data.  How the Spaces differ is based solely on permissions granted by you, the owner of the Data Hub.   

Learn more about [Spaces](/docs/concepts/spaces.md).

#### File Sharing

In addition to Spaces, DASSET offers the ability to share individual files with others.  This offers a quick and simple way to share that perfect picture, or your resume, with a few clicks of the mouse or taps of the finger, without copying files to specific Spaces.

* **Sharing a file with other DASSET users** - Whether you invited another person to share your Data Hub, or they have a Data Hub themselves, means they have a DASSET user account.  Sharing an individual file in this case is as simple as clicking "share" on the file, and choosing the DASSET user to share the file with.  This does not send them the file, rather they have access to the file on your Data Hub.  When sharing, you can set specific permissions to the file, such as "view only" as well as an expiration date.  You can also revoke access at any time.

* **Sharing a file with anyone** - If the person you want to share a file with does not have or want to set-up a DASSET user account, you can still send them the file.  Using the native share capability on PCs and smartphones today, you simple share the file as an attachment which can then be sent using SMS, email, or any application you have installed that support sharing.

:::caution

When sending a file to a non-DASSET user, they receive an actual copy of the file.  You won't have control over their access once sent, so use caution!

:::

### üåé Access from anywhere

It's easy to access data connected to your home network, but what about if you're away from home, for example on a trip or vacation?  Your data is only valuable if you can access it easily, quickly and most importantly, securely.

Unfortunately, configuring a home network to allow incoming access is complex, and is fraught with risk.  If the wrong settings are configured, you're inviting data thieves to infiltrate your network and steal your data.

**DASSET Instant Connect** provides the ability to connect to your Data Hub regardless of location.  It is built on Software-Defined Networking/Software-Defined Virtual Network (SDN/SDVN) technology that configures a secure, point-to-point connection between your DASSET client application and the Data Hub, ensuring that you can securely access the data on your Data Hub, from anywhere.

Learn how [DASSET Instant Connect](../concepts/dasset-instant-connect.md) works.

### üîê Store secret sensitive data

The **Data Vault** is an application within the DASSET client application that adds an extra layer of protection for sensitive data, such as pin numbers or crypto wallet keys.  In addition to your account credentials to access the Data Vault, you also provide a unique password required to access the data stored.

### üìÑ File de-duplication

When copying all of your data from your various devices and clouds to your DASSET-powered Data Hub, you're bound to have multiple copies of the same files.  Finding and removing the copies can be a tedious task as you may not even know where they are.

DASSET's built-in de-duplication application allows you to scan your Data Hub for duplicate files, including determining what is or is not considered a duplicate.  

Learn how the [File De-duplication](../features/apps/de-duplication.md) works.

### üóëÔ∏è Recycle Bin

Accidentally delete a file when using de-duplicating your files?  No worries as DASSET includes a Recycle Bin which keeps your deleted files for 30 days, so you have ample time to restore those inadvertent deletions.

Learn how the [Recycle Bin](../features/apps/recycle.md) works.


### üéâ And much more

We're currently developing even more applications for DASSET, as well as working with other software vendors to create applications optimized for the DASSET software platform.
