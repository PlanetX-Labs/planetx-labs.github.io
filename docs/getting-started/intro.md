# Introduction

## Our data dilemma

We're creating more data today than ever.  Pictures, videos, documents are the obvious culprits, but there's also the data generated by your video doorbell, your smart thermostat and any other "smart" device you may have connected to your home network.

Where is all this data?  Likely in "the cloud" as well as scattered across various devices like PCs, your smartphone and USB drives hidden in the kitchen drawer somewhere.  It's either not easily accessible, lost or held by a large cloud company where your privacy is at risk.

What if you had all of that data, in one location, always available and accessible, and more importantly - all completely secure and private?  Sound too good to be true?  Well it's not.

## DASSET for Data Hub

<img src={require("./dasset-data-hub.png").default} />

DASSET is a software solution designed to bring all of your data together in one location while making it available to access from anywhere - even if you're half-way across the globe.

Computer manufacturers, like the one who built the computer you're probably reading this article on right now, build the Data Hub hardware that runs the DASSET software.  Think of a Data Hub as a small computer with lots of storage and is connected to your home network.  Running the DASSET software, it connects to your devices and your cloud storage, and brings your data to you - where it should be. 

This has a few benefits:

1. Your data is no longer scattered across disconnected services and devices.
2. Accessing the data is faster because it's not in some data center across the internet (or in the kitchen drawer).
3. You have complete control over how your data is shared with others - or not at all.
4. No monthly fees.

## What DASSET does for you

Data Hubs powered by the DASSET software are more than just storage devices connected to your home or small business network.  As the hub of your digital life, DASSET is rich with applications and capabilities for your everday life.

### üôå Simple set-up

Setting up your DASSET-powered Data Hub is as easy as 1-2-3.  Simply plug-in your Data Hub, connect it to your network and turn it on.  After downloading the DASSET application for your smartphone, simply scan the QR code on your Data Hub and voila - you're connected.  That's it.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Automated backup & sync

DASSET supports multiple ways to get your data together on the Data Hub.  Whether you want to move your data from another location to your Data Hub, or synchronize the data, keeping both copies up to date, DASSET has you covered.

#### Cloud Sync

The following clouds are currently available to synchronize your data with your DASSET Data Hub:

1. Google Drive
2. Microsoft OneDrive
3. Dropbox

<img src={require("./cloud-sync-setup2.png").default} style={{transform:'scale(.80)'}} />

:::info

Additional cloud services will be available for Cloud Sync as support becomes available from the cloud vendors.

:::

During the set-up of your DASSET Data Hub, you are given the option to connect to the above cloud solutions and configure a synchronization policy for the synchronization.  You can choose a one-way synchronization, which copies data from either the cloud to your Data Hub, or vice-versa or you can choose a bi-directional copy, keeping both locations synced.  Additionally, during the configuration process, you can choose a schedule for how often you want to have the synchronization occur.  

#### Device back up

In addition to synchronizing your clouds, any device running the DASSET client application can also have it's data synchronized to the Data Hub.  For example, you can easily ensure all of the pictures and videos on your smartphone are automatically backed-up on the Data Hub.  

The DASSET client application is available on the following platforms:

* ![Android](android16x16.png)  Android ([download on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.weline.dasset))
* ![iOS](ios16x16.png)  iOS (coming soon)
* ![Windows](windows16x16.png)  Windows (coming soon)
* ![MacOS](macos16x16.png)  MacOS (coming soon)

Devices such as USB hard drives, SSDs or thumbdrives can also connect directly to the Data Hub, where you can copy your data between the two with ease.

### üîç Intelligent search and retrieval

Having all of your data in one location isn't all that useful unless you can easily find it.  The built-in intelligent search in DASSET uses AI to help easily find what you're looking for, regardless of where it's stored on your Data Hub.  

### üñºÔ∏è Smart photo management

There are over 5 trillion digital photos in existance.  Since the introduction of smartphones with built-in cameras, that continue to improve every year, we take lots of photos with little thought of how we're going to consume and manage the digital trove of memories we've collected.

Simply storing your digital photos on the Data Hub isn't enough by itself.  Included with DASSET is the AI Photos application, which enables you to view, edit, categorize and tag your photos.  Some of the specific capabilities are as follows:

* Automatic grouping of photos of the same person for face-tagging.
* The ability to detect scenery, such as mountains or oceans, automatically tagging your photos for easy searching.
* A map view of the locations of groupings of photos based on the GPS data encoded in the EXIF metadata of the picture for easily finding that family vacation to Cambodia.

As we continue to add features to DASSET, the inclusion of additional AI capabilities will be coming such as photo correction, natural language search and more.

### üéÅ Securely share with anyone

The ability to share your memories and information with others is a core tenet of DASSET, while ensuring you have control over how your data is shared.  DASSET provides multiple ways to share with others, offering flexibility so you can share on your terms.

####  Spaces

The DASSET client application gives you "Spaces" to determine what data you want to share, or collaborate, with others.  You can invite others to access your DASSET-powered Data Hub, which gives them the ability to store and share their data.  How the Spaces differ is based solely on permissions granted by you, the owner of the Data Hub.   

* **My Space** - This is where all of your data is stored by default.  Accessible only to you, it's your private repository of your data.  When you invite others to your Data Hub, they will have their own "My Space", which is accessible only to them.  Not even you, as the owner of the Data Hub, can view their data unless granted by the owner.  Think of this as the "home" of your data.
* **Public Space** - This is a shared space, where anyone invited to the Data Hub can freely share data with one another.  This of this as the "town square" of data.
* **Group Space** - Like the Public Space, the Group Space is a shared space.  The primary difference is you can determine who is, or is not, included in the Group Space.  Great for collaboration between friends or colleages, think of this as the "members only club" of data.

#### File Sharing

In addition to Spaces, DASSET offers the ability to share individual files with others.  This offers a quick and simple way to share that perfect picture, or your resume, with a few clicks of the mouse or taps of the finger, without copying files to specific Spaces.

* **Sharing a file with other DASSET users** - Whether you invited another person to share your Data Hub, or they have a Data Hub themselves, means they have a DASSET user account.  Sharing an individual file in this case is as simple as clicking "share" on the file, and choosing the DASSET user to share the file with.  This does not send them the file, rather they have access to the file on your Data Hub.  When sharing, you can set specific permissions to the file, such as "view only" as well as an expiration date.  You can also revoke access at any time.

<img src={require("./sharing.gif").default} style={{transform:'scale(.80)'}} />

* **Sharing a file with anyone** - If the person you want to share a file with does not have or want to set-up a DASSET user account, you can still send them the file.  Using the native share capability on PCs and smartphones today, you simple share the file as an attachment which can then be sent using SMS, email, or any application you have installed that support sharing.

:::caution

When sending a file to a non-DASSET user, they recieve an actual copy of the file.  You won't have control over their access once sent, so use caution!

### üåé Access from anywhere

It's easy to access data connected to your home network, but what about if you're away from home, for example on a trip or vacation?  Your data is only valuable if you can access it easily, quickly and most importantly, securely.

Unfortunately, configuring a home network to allow incoming access is complex, and is fraught with risk.  If the wrong settings are configured, you're inviting data theives to infiltrate your network and steal your data.

**DASSET Instant Connect** provides the ability to connect to your Data Hub regardless of location.  It is built on Software-Defined Networking/Software-Defined Virtual Network (SDN/SDVN) technology that configures a secure, point-to-point connection between your DASSET client application and the Data Hub, ensuring that you can securely access the data on your Data Hub, from anywhere.

Learn how [DASSET Instant Connect](../concepts/dasset-instant-connect.md) works.

### üîê Store secret sensitive data

The **Data Vault** is an application within the DASSET client application that adds an extra layer of protection for sensitive data, such as pin numbers or crypto wallet keys.  In addition to your account credentials to access the Data Vault, you also provide a unique password required to access the data stored.

### üìÑ Data de-duplication

When copying all of your data from your various devices and clouds to your DASSET-powered Data Hub, you're bound to have multiple copies of the same files.  Finding and removing the copies can be a tedious task as you may not even know where they are.

DASSET's built-in de-duplication application allows you to scan your Data Hub for duplicate files, including determining what is or is not considered a duplicate.  By choosing whether you want files with longer names to be kept, such as "20240502_1.jpg" vs. "20240502.jpg", or by time and date, you have control over which files are selected by the default "Smart Choice" of files for deletion.  Additionally, you are able to review the files before deletion, to ensure you're choosing the correct file.

### üóëÔ∏è Recycle Bin

Accidentally delete a file when using de-duplicating your files?  No worries as DASSET includes a Recycle Bin which keeps your deleted files for 30 days, so you have ample time to restore those inadvertant deletions.


### üéâ And much more

We're currently developing even more applications for DASSET, as well as working with other software vendors to create applications optimized for the DASSET software platform.
