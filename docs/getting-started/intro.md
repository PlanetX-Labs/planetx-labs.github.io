# DASSET for Data Hub

## Our data is out of control

In our interconnected world, data is often scattered across various locations—multiple computers, mobile devices, external hard drives, and of course, the ubiquitous “clouds.” If you’re an iPhone or Mac user, your data likely resides in iCloud. Windows PC enthusiasts probably rely on OneDrive, while Android phone owners find their data comfortably nestled in Google Drive.

But here’s the conundrum: Where is that document I wrote last week? Is it in OneDrive, or perhaps it was in Google Drive? Do I have a copy on my computer? Oh no — I have three copies of it across all locations. Which one is the right one? 🤔

This is the data maze world we live in — where versions multiply, and our digital breadcrumbs lead us down countless paths.

Even if all of our devices are from one vendor, when we entrust our personal data to public clouds, we’re essentially granting custody to the cloud vendors. But it's more than just files stored in the cloud. Much more. 

## DASSET for Data Hub

PlanetX Labs was founded on the guiding principle that personal and business data is a critical asset that deserves to be managed with the utmost care and expertise. We aim to achieve our mission through producing the software platform for computer manufacturers to build the Data Hub, powered by the DASSET software platform.  We aim to give users choice in deciding which computer manufacturer to purchase a Data Hub from.  Regardless of which computer manufacturer they choose, any Data Hub powered by DASSET will work with one another.

The DASSET software platform is designed to achieve the following core scenarios:  

### 1 - Easy to use

Our platform is designed for use by anyone rather than the technically adept.  From initial set-up to everyday use, ease of use is a core tenet of the design principles of the entire DASSET platform.  No complex initial set-up or fiddling with network settings to enable connectivity to your Data Hub from the internet - simply scan a QR code and you're connected.  From anywhere.

### 2 - Centralized data management

Designed to bring all of your data together in a unified location, DASSET synchronizes data from your cloud services and your devices.  Additionally, users can sync data from their devices running the DASSET client application (Android, iOS, Windows and MacOS) as well as sync data from externally attached storage devices, such as USB drives.

### 3 - Universal Search

With all of your data synchronized in a single location, having the ability to find what you’re looking for is easy with the powerful search capabilities of DASSET.  

### 4 - Seamless, Secure Connectivity

Whether you are on the same network or half-way across the world, connectivity to DASSET is fast and secure.  With DASSET Instant Connect, our proprietary networking technology, you have the security of a point to point VPN without the hassle of setting-up and configuring a VPN service.

### 5 - Secure & Easy Sharing

Invite friends, family or colleagues to your DASSET to share files, give them secure space to store their private data, with simple role-based access controls where you decide who gets access to what. 

### 6 - Future-Ready AI Integration

While the current iteration of DASSET is focused on organization and security, our roadmap includes the integration of AI capabilities. This will advance DASSET from a mere organizer to a system that provides actionable insights, offering recommendations and automating tasks based on your data usage patterns.

### 7 - and much more...

A DASSET-powered Data Hub is like any other appliance in your home or small business.  It does not require regular management or maintenance - it just works.  In addition to being your "digital brain", it does the following:

* 🔑  Invite others to your Data Hub, with secure space for them to store thier data
* 🎁  Share files with anyone with ease - no more sharing using text messages that degrade photo 
  quality
* 🔐  Store secret data, such as passwords, account numbers or private keys in an encrypted Data Vault
* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦  Create groups to share data with a set of friends or colleagues to collaborate
* 🎞️  Stream your movies or photos to devices in your home, such as your TV
* 🎉  And more coming soon!
