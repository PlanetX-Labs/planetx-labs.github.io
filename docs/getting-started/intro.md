# Introduction

The amount of data we generate continues to grow on a daily basis, a trend which will only
increase as technology continues to evolve (higher-pixel pictures/video, devices connected
to our home networks, etc).  While the cloud may seem like an easy way to store all of this
data, there are challenges that may not seem apparent at first, but become more obvious the
more data you have to store:

1. Accessing data stored in the cloud isn't fast.  Want to edit a 4GB video quickly?  You'll 
   need to download it first. 
2. It's not as cheap as you think.  Most cloud vendors offer free storage - to a point.  Once
   you need more, you're subject to monthly subscription charges.

**Dasset** is a smart data storage solution designed to bring all of your data together.  With
a user experience designed for everyone, you don't need to be technical to use Dasset.  The
software that powers Dasset consists of the following:

* **Dasset server operating system and firmware** used to power your Dasset server.
* **Dasset client application** used to access your Dasset server.

## Server OS & Firmware

The magic behind storing your data safely and sharing securely with others is powered by the Dasset
server operating system and associated firmware.  Devices running the Dasset server software
components are provided by computer manufacturers

Computer manufacturers are currently building Dasset servers.  Check back soon for direct links
to where you can purchase your Dasset server!

Dasset servers are **headless**, meaning that they do not connect to a computer monitor, keyboard or
mouse.  Instead, you interact with the Dasset server through the Dasset client application.
