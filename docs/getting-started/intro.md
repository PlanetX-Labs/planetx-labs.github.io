# Introduction

## Are you in control of your data?

The amount of data we generate daily is growing at astronomical rates.  Technological
advances are what's behind this explosion in data generation.  Cameras in phones continue
to increase in quality.  Home devices, such as doorbell cameras and smart home appliances,
generate video and usage pattern data.  As our digital footprint grows, we struggle with the
ability to easily find what we're looking for.

You should own, and have complete control, over your data.  It's a simple concept, but one
that is not fully realized with existing data storage solutions.  While the cloud may seem like
an easy way to store all of this data, there are challenges that may not seem apparent at first,
but become more obvious the more data you have to store:

* üê¢ Accessing data stored in the cloud isn't fast.  Want to edit a 10GB video quickly?  You'll 
   need to download it first. 

* üíµ  It's not as cheap as you think.  Most cloud vendors offer free storage - to a point.  Once
   you need more, you're subject to monthly subscription charges.

* üîê Storing your data in the cloud means you're giving control over to the cloud provider.

The only solution to complete control over your data is to have it all on a device that you own.
But keeping all of your data on your device is a challenge.  Most PCs don't come with enough storage
for the amount of data we have.  Adding additional storage to your computer isn't easy, is prone
to failure, and difficult to manage as your data is spread across multiple drives.

The solution is a storage device, connected to home or business network, that has the capacity
to store all of your data, with the ability to easily secure and share that data with others.

## Your data is your asset

The primary purpose of your data is to derive value from the information the data contains.  When
you look at your photos and videos, you have the ability to relive moments of your life.  You gain
insight into planning for your future when you access your financial files.  You are able to make
a living when you access the data you use for your livelihood.

But your data is more than your legacy - **it's your asset.**  And today you're not benefitting
from the ability to monetize those assets.  Instead, other parties are doing so.  And usually without you even realizing it's happening.

### üß¨ Example - Your DNA 

It may seem tempting to use one of the services that sends you a home kit to swab your DNA and send it back in for analysis.  You get a nice report of your ancestral traits, whether you have 
genes known for certain diseases or even if you're prone to like or dislike the taste of cilantro.

In exchange for this nice report, you give rights to the company to use your genetic information.
They, in turn, can offer it to research laboratories interested in specific genes you may posses
- in exchange for a fee.  The company is making money off of your genetic information.  You've
given them rights to do so.

### üñäÔ∏è Example - AI & WGA 

The recent agreement between the Writer's Guild of America (WGA) and the Alliance of Motion 
Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) highlights how the technological advances in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) can have a devastating impact on the value of a Writer's data.
