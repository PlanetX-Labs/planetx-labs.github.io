# Introduction

## Our data dilemma

Our most precious **memories and vital information** no longer rest safely in photo albums, attics, or filing cabinets. Instead, they **are scattered across the sprawling datacenters** of tech giants—our family photos, financial records, cherished music, and personal documents, entrusted to corporations like Apple and Google. These companies don’t just act as custodians; **they commodify our digital lives**, transforming our private moments into data streams that **fuel their profit machines**. They hold the keys to our digital existence, deciding who can access what, and when, all while **monetizing our trust**. But this isn’t their story to tell. It’s time we reclaim the narrative. **It’s time we take back control of what is rightfully ours: our data.**

## DASSET for Data Hub

<img src={require("./dasset-data-hub.png").default} />

**DASSET** is a next-generation **smart personal data hub** that gives you the convenience of the cloud **without handing your data to third parties.** Unlike traditional cloud services where your files reside on someone else’s server, DASSET runs on hardware **you own**, such as a home NAS device or small server​. This means you **keep full control of your data** at all times – your photos, documents, and backups stay with you, protected and private. Yet, you still enjoy **cloud-like accessibility**: you can reach your files from anywhere via apps or web, auto-sync across your devices, and even opt for encrypted cloud backup on your terms​.

## What DASSET does for you

### Complete Privacy & Data Ownership
With DASSET, you are the sole owner of your information. Your files aren’t stored in big data centers where companies might scan or data-mine them​. All data stays on your device, and powerful encryption (AES-256) secures your content at rest and in transit​. In essence, your personal data remains truly private – **no prying eyes, no unwelcome surprises.**

### Security and Peace of Mind
DASSET is built with a **privacy-first security model.** Your hub uses robust encryption (the same standard banks use) and the latest secure protocols to fend off threats​. Since your data isn’t concentrated in a big cloud server (a common target for hackers), the risk of mass data breaches is greatly reduced. You decide what gets shared and what stays completely offline, giving you peace of mind that sensitive documents or family videos never leave your possession without consent.

### Cloud Convenience, No Cloud Costs
Enjoy the **ease of access** of cloud storage **without the ongoing fees or bandwidth costs.** There are **no monthly subscriptions** required to use DASSET – it’s your hardware, so you’re not renting space from a provider​. Whether you’re at home or traveling, you can instantly get to your files. Even if your internet is down, you can still access everything over your local network at full speed. DASSET also offers optional cloud backup or remote relay features if you choose, but **nothing is mandatory** – it’s all under your control.

### Smart Organization & Search
Say goodbye to endless manual sorting. DASSET has **built-in AI** (running locally for privacy) that can automatically organize your data. For example, it can tag and categorize your photos by who’s in them, where they were taken, or events – all **without sending images to any external cloud​.** You can then search your collection in natural language (e.g. “show my beach trip photos from last summer”) and get results instantly​. Important documents can be auto-categorized (receipts, passports, tax forms, etc.), and you can even ask your personal DASSET assistant to find a file by description. It’s like having your own **private AI librarian**, making sense of your files while keeping your data safe.

### Easy to Set Up & Use
You don’t need to be tech-savvy to use DASSET. It’s designed for **quick, plug-and-play setup** – most users can get it running in under 15 minutes​. There’s no complex networking or coding required: a guided installation and even a QR-code mobile setup take care of the heavy lifting​. Once running, DASSET’s interface is **clean and intuitive**​, whether you access it from your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Backups and sync happen automatically in the background, and you can easily share files or folders with family and colleagues via simple links. In short, it’s a **user-friendly experience** – all the good parts of the cloud, minus the cloud hassles.
