# Account Settings
Your DASSET User Account can be used on several DASSET Data Hubs, rather than having to create new accounts for each Data Hub you have been invited to join.  If you only have 1 Data Hub, then the relationship between Account and Data Hub is 1:1.  However, if you have 2 friends who have invited you to join their Data Hubs, the Account to Data Hub relationship is 1:3.

To access the **Account Settings** feature of DASSET from the **Home Screen**, simply the *Back Arrow* in the top-left of the **Home Screen**, and click on the *Account Settings* icon in the top-right of the **Account Screen**.

## Account Information
Selecting the **Account Information** link will give you the option to view and configure the following:

1. **<u>Avatar</u>** - Gives you the option to replace the default user avatar with a picture or other image of your choosing.  The avatar you set will be visible to other users who you are sharing your Data Hub with, or if you have been invited to join another user's Data Hub.
2. **<u>Nick Name</u>** - By default, DASSET will assign a random GUID for your Nick Name.  You can change this to something more personal or fun if you wish.  Your Nick Name will be visible to other users who you are sharing your Data Hub with, or if you have been invited to join another user's Data Hub.
3. **<u>Phone Number</u>** - If you registered your DASSET User Account using your phone number, it will be visible here. You can add/change your phone number here as an alternate way to secure your DASSET User Account.
4. **<u>Email</u>** - If you registered your DASSET User Account using your email address, it will be visible here.  You can add/change your email address as an alternate way to secure your DASSET User Account.
5. **<u>Password</u>** - Gives you the option to change your DASSET User Account Password.  You must enter your current password in order to change the password to something new.  If you forgot your current password, you can perform a password reset, which will send you and email or SMS message with a verification code to proceed.

2. **<u>Log out and forget account</u>** which logs you out of the DASSET service and clears  your user name and password from the login fields for extra security.
