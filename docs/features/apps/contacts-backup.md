# Contacts Back-Up
In addition to data we think of as files and photos, DASSET also offers the ability to back-up other types of data that is important to you - like your contacts on your phone.  **Contacts Backup** provides a simple way to back-up, and restore, your contacts.

**Contacts Backup** can be found in the **Applications** section of the **Home Screen** of DASSET.  When initially opening the application, you'll be guided through a quick wizard granting access to your phone's contacts to initiate your first back-up.

Contacts backed-up from your device include those in your contacts management application, those stored on your SIM as well as email.
