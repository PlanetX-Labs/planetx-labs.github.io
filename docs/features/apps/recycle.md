# Recycle Bin
Like most operating systems, DASSET comes with the ability to restore files accidentally deleted by the user.  The **Recycle Bin** is where all files deleted on the system are placed, giving you the ability to undo those "Oops" moments of deleting a file inadvertently.

</p>

The **Recycle Bin** can be found in the **Applications** section of the **Home Screen** of DASSET.  Once opened, it will show you all files that have been deleted over the past 30 days.  Files are automatically removed from the **Recycle Bin** after the 30th day the file was deleted by the user.

## Restoring & Deleting Items in the Recycle Bin
If you need to restore a file from the **Recycle Bin**, or want to permanently delete the file from your DASSET Data Hub, open the **Recycle Bin** application, select the file(s) you wish to delete or restore, and select the appropriate action.

</p>

:::caution

Once you delete items from the Recycle Bin, they are permanently deleted from your Data Hub.
