# Album Back-up
Bringing all of your data together in a single, secure location is a fundamental tenet of DASSET.  **Album Backup** provides an easy way to ensure the photos on your phone, tablet or computer, are easily and automatically backed-up to your DASSET Data Hub.

</p>

## Start a Backup
**Album Backup** can be found in the **Applications** section of the **Home Screen** of DASSET.  Once opened, you will be prompted through a wizard which will ask for access to your device's photo libraries, which is required in order to back-up the photos from your device.  You will then be prompted to select which albums on your device you wish to back-up.

Once you have selected the albums for back-up, select **Backup ## Albums**.

</p>

## Album Backup Settings
You will be presented with the **Album Backup Settings** screen after starting your first backup, which will show you the status of your initial back up at the top of the screen.  When opening **Album Backup** in the future, you will be brought directly to this screen rather than going through the initial set-up wizard.

### Automatic Album Backup
Toggling this will ensure that whenever new photos are added to your device, then when you start the DASSET application, those photos will be automatically backed-up.

### Select Album
During the set-up wizard, you selected the albums to back-up from your device.  If you add new albums to your device, or wish to remove albums for back-up, you can do so here.

### Select Destination
By default, your photos are backed-up to **My Space/Album Backup/PHONE NAME**.  You can choose to back-up your photos to any other [Spaces](../../concepts/spaces.md) your account has access to, or change the default folder in your My Space to another location.

### Backup Networks
This gives you the option to have backups only occur when on Wi-Fi, or both Wi-Fi and mobile networks.

### Backup Progress
While the progress of your backup is at the top of this screen, you can access the progress at any time without having to open the **Album Backup** application.

The ![image](album-backup-progress-icon.png) icon located at the top-right corner of your screen is visible from the [Home Screen](../../features/homescreen.md) of DASSET, which shows not only the status of your Album Backup, but any file transfers in progress.
