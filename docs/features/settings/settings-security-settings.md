# Security Settings
If you want to add additional security to your DASSET Data Hub, you can do so in the **Security Settings** screen.

<p align="center">
<img src={require("./settings-security-settings.png").default} style={{transform:'scale(1.0)'}} />
</p>

The **Security Settings** screen provides access to change the following, which are global for all users that have access to the Data Hub.

## Show hidden files and folders
Toggling this option will make any files or folders that are marked with the *hidden* property visible to all users in the system.  This setting is off by default.

## Personal Password
Enables you to set a secondary, global password for all users of the system when accessing files on the Data Hub.

## Public Space Password
Enables you to set a secondary, global password for all users of the system when accessing files of the [Public Space](../../concepts/spaces.md).

:::info

Since secondary passwords are global for all users, make sure you share the password you have set to users you intend for access.
