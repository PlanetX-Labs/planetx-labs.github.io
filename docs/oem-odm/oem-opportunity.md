# DASSET for OEMs

## A "Blue Ocean" Opportunity in Smart Storage

As an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in the storage or smart home industry, partnering with PlanetX Labs’ **DASSET** platform opens up a **new market space** and a chance to significantly differentiate your products. DASSET is a cutting-edge software solution that transforms standard compute+storage hardware into an AI-powered, privacy-first data hub. By offering devices with DASSET pre-installed, OEMs can step out of the crowded commodity NAS market and **sail into a “blue ocean” of new demand** – providing customers an experience they can’t get elsewhere. In short, DASSET lets you offer a **unique value proposition** (intelligent, user-controlled storage) under your own brand, giving you a compelling edge over competitors.

Current NAS and cloud solutions in the market each have their limitations. None combine **on-device AI, robust privacy, and ease of use** in a single package the way DASSET does​. This means there is a sizable segment of consumers and small businesses looking for smarter storage solutions that existing products aren’t fully satisfying. By integrating DASSET into your hardware, you can **instantly position your devices in a class of their own**. Out of the box, a DASSET-powered device offers features like automatic photo organization, natural language search, and local AI analytics – capabilities that traditionally were only found (in limited form) in big cloud ecosystems, not in personal storage devices. Now users can have that intelligence and keep their data on-premises.

For an OEM, this is a chance to **leapfrog competitors** without years of in-house software R&D. You focus on making great hardware, and PlanetX Labs provides the sophisticated software layer that today’s users demand. The result is a **premium product** that commands differentiation – customers will see your device as not just another NAS, but as a “smart personal cloud” solution. In strategy terms, this is a blue ocean: instead of fighting on price or incremental features (where everyone else competes), you’re creating a new category where you are the leader. Early adopters of DASSET in the OEM space can capture loyal customers who value privacy and control, gain press and industry attention for innovation, and set higher price points justified by the richer feature set.

## Flexible Licensing and Branding Options

PlanetX Labs offers licensing models tailored for OEM partners, ensuring you have flexibility in how you bring DASSET to market with your products. There are two primary tiers currently available​:

* **DASSET OEM Basic** – This includes the core DASSET functionality that we’ve described (the essential NAS features and baseline AI capabilities) under **your branding**. You can **white-label** the software as your own NAS OS if desired, while still advertising the advanced features it provides. PlanetX Labs will assist with basic hardware optimization for your specific device (ensuring drivers and performance are tuned) and will supply co-branded marketing materials to help launch the product​. This option is great for OEMs who want to enhance their devices’ feature list quickly and prefer the product to appear under their own brand umbrella.
  
* **DASSET OEM Premium** - This tier unlocks **the full feature set of DASSET**, including all advanced AI and any cloud-integration features available​. OEMs at this level can still fully brand the software to their liking, but also have the option for **co-branding** with PlanetX (e.g. “Powered by DASSET”) if that adds value in marketing. Premium licensing comes with deeper collaboration: PlanetX Labs provides intensive hardware-specific optimizations, joint marketing campaigns, and technical integration support to tailor the software perfectly to your device​. There’s even the possibility to request custom features exclusive to your hardware – for instance, if your device has a unique sensor or accelerator, PlanetX can help integrate support for it. Premium partners effectively get a **bespoke solution** built on the DASSET platform, plus strong go-to-market backing from PlanetX.

Both licensing models are designed to ensure the **OEM retains brand visibility and customer relationship**. Whether you choose a silent integration or a co-branded approach, you’ll be able to present the solution as a unique offering of your product line. Some OEMs may opt to use their own UI skin or add complementary apps – DASSET is flexible enough to accommodate such customizations. The key is that, under the hood, the user gets the full power of DASSET, and you as the OEM get a proven software and networking backbone maintained by PlanetX.

## Co-Marketing and Revenue Sharing Opportunities

PlanetX Labs is keen on partnering for mutual **success**. When you integrate DASSET, you're not left to do all the marketing education alone. OEM partners receive co-marketing **support** - this can range from being featured in PlanetX's marketing channels (press releases, website showcases, joint case studies) to having ready-made marketing collateral (videos, comparison charts, demo scripts) that you can use in your campaigns. Joint branding opportunities, like a "Powered by **DASSET**" badge on your product, can lend credibility and communicate advanced capabilities to customers. PlanetX can also assist in training your sales team on how to pitch the unique benefits of a DASSET-powered device, ensuring you can clearly articulate the value to distributors and end buyers. 

Another aspect is the potential for revenue **sharing** on software services. For example, DASSET includes an app marketplace and optional premium software features (such as subscription-based cloud backup or advanced AI packs). As an OEM, you can arrange to get a share of revenue when users of your devices purchase premium software or services through the DASSET ecosystem. This aligns incentives: both you and PlanetX benefit from a larger active user base that engages with the platform. It's a model similar to how smartphone manufacturers benefit from app store ecosystems. By participating, you're not just selling a one-time hardware box; you can tap into ongoing software revenue streams. PlanetX Labs is open to crafting these arrangements to ensure a win-win scenario. 

Finally, with a differentiated product, your market **positioning** improves. Media and reviewers are more likely to highlight a NAS device that boasts AI capabilities and privacy focus. This can amplify your marketing efforts through organic PR. We've seen that consumers are increasingly concerned about data privacy (91% of users prefer solutions where they physically control data) - by aligning with DASSET, you can confidently market privacy and control as a feature, backed by tangible tech that supports those claims.

## Technical Integration, Certification, and Support

Adopting a new software platform may sound daunting, but PlanetX Labs has a comprehensive OEM integration **program** to ensure a smooth path from development to launch. Here's what OEMs can expect in terms of technical partnership:

- **Engineering Consultation and Early Access:** From day one, PlanetX engineers will work with your hardware team to optimize DASSET for your device. This includes guidance on hardware selection (CPU, memory, storage configuration) if you're in design phase, and performance tuning if you have existing hardware. OEM partners get early access to upcoming DASSET features and updates, so you can plan your product roadmap in sync and even influence features that are important to your customers.

- **Certification - "DASSET Inside" Badge:** PlanetX offers a certification process to verify that your device runs DASSET optimally and securely. They will test your hardware against benchmarks for performance, stability, and security hardening. Devices that meet the criteria can carry the "DASSET **Inside"** badge or a similar certification mark. This not only assures customers of a quality experience, but also gives your product a marketing differentiator. Certification typically comes hand-in-hand with tuning recommendations - for example, if a certain storage controller needs a custom driver for best results, PlanetX will help develop and integrate that.

- **Integration Tools and Documentation:** You'll receive detailed integration documentation specific to OEMs - covering how to flash or install DASSET on your devices in manufacturing, how to configure default settings or branding, and how to bundle license keys if needed. Tools for automation (imaging the software onto devices at scale) are provided. In addition, reference designs and sample configurations are available, since PlanetX has tested DASSET on various reference hardware. This can significantly cut down the time your engineers spend on software bring-up.

- **Ongoing Updates and Long-Term Support:** One huge advantage of partnering on software is offloading maintenance. PlanetX Labs will handle regular software **updates** for DASSET, delivering new features, improvements, and security patches over the air to devices in the field. This keeps your product fresh and secure without your team having to develop those updates. Of course, all updates are tested for compatibility with certified hardware. If needed, you can get updates early in a staging environment to validate before wider rollout. PlanetX's commitment is that a device launched with DASSET will continue to get cutting-edge capabilities over its life, prolonging its relevance in the **market**.

- **Training and Support for OEMs:** Your support and ops teams will be backed by PlanetX
expertise. They provide training materials and **resources** for your customer support reps so they can handle end-user questions about the DASSET software. If deeper issues arise, PlanetX offers an OEM support channel where your engineers can directly reach out for help in troubleshooting software-related issues. Essentially, you gain a partner who is as invested in the success of the end-customer as you are. This can be critical when selling to business customers who might have advanced queries - you won't be on your own to answer them.
