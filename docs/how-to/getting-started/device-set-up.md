## Step 2: Bind your Data Hub
You will be presented with 2 options to connect to your Data Hub, also known as [Binding](../../concepts/device-binding.md).

1. **QR Code Scan** - By default, the DASSET application will open your phone's camera to scan the QR Code that is a sticker either on your Data Hub, or in the pamphlet that came with your device.
2. **Add via LAN Search** - Below the camera window in the app is a link to **Add via LAN Search**, which scans your local area network for the device.  Select this option if you cannot scan the QR code for some reason.

After completing either the QR Code scan or LAN Search, your Data Hub should show-up in the results window.  Click **Bind this device** to complete the [Binding](../../concepts/device-binding.md) process.
