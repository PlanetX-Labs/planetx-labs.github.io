# Install the DASSET app
The DASSET application is the way you access the data and applications on your DASSET Data Hub, or a Data Hub that has been shared with you by other Data Hub users.  Once you have the DASSET application installed, you can configure alternative ways to access your files, such as using [SAMBA](../../features/apps/samba.md) which allows you to mount your Data Hub as a mapped drive in Windows or MacOS.

## Step 1: Download DASSET
The DASSET application is available for Android and iPhone mobile devices and tablets, as well as Windows and MacOS computers.

Download DASSET on your device to get started:

## Step 3: Log in & Configure
Once you've successfully created your user account, you will be prompted to sign-in for the first time.  When doing so, DASSET will ask for the following permissions:

* <u>**Access to photos and videos on this device**</u> - In order to provide the ability to perform functions such as **Album Backup**, this permission is needed to access your device's camera role.
* <u>**Access to music and audio on this device**</u> - In order to provide the ability to play music stored on your device, this permission is needed.

</p>

When permissions are granted, DASSET never sends your data to PlanetX Labs or any other 3rd parties.

Additionally, you will be asked whether to allow DASSET to send notifications to your phone.
