# FAQs

### What exactly is a DASSET Data Hub?

A DASSET Data Hub is a Network-Attached Storage (NAS) device that connects to your home or business network to store your data.  It contains one or more Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) or Solid-State Drives (SSDs) that can hold much more data than your typical computer.  By having your data stored on a DASSET Data Hub, you can have access to all of your personal or business data from your computer or mobile device without having to store it in a public cloud service.

### How is a DASSET Data Hub different from a NAS?

A DASSET Data Hub device is a NAS, but designed for everyday users, not just tech-enthusiasts.  No complex configuration of network settings to get access to your Data Hub from anywhere, simple photo management including face-tagging and scene detection, DASSET is designed with ease of use first.

### What is DASSET AI?

DASSET AI is the artificial intelligence engine that powers your personal and private AI.  It uses a hybrid AI approach, processing your personal data for AI queries locally while using the public cloud for processing non-sensitive data.  With DASSET AI, you can generate images, summarize documents and notes, and create a private library of data that never leaves your device.

### When can I buy a DASSET Data Hub?

We are working with several major computer manufacturers to produce DASSET Data Hubs, with expected availability by the middle of 2025.

### How much will a DASSET Data Hub cost?

DASSET will be available in multiple configurations, from entry-level to higher-end configurations.  More details will be coming soon.

### What devices can I use with a DASSET Data Hub?

DASSET is designed to be accessed from apps from your mobile devices (Android or iOS), or your computer (Windows and MacOS).
