# FAQs

### What exactly is a DASSET Data Hub?

A DASSET Data Hub is a Network-Attached Storage (NAS) device that connects to your home or business network to store your data.  It contains one or more Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) or Solid-State Drives (SSDs) that can hold much more data than your typical computer.  By having your data stored on a DASSET Data Hub, you can have access to all of your personal or business data from your computer or mobile device without having to store it in a public cloud service.

### How is a DASSET Data Hub different from a NAS?

A DASSET Data Hub device is a NAS, but designed for everyday users, not just tech-enthusiasts.  No complex configuration of network settings to get access to your Data Hub from anywhere, simple photo management including face-tagging and scene detection, DASSET is designed with ease of use first.

### What is DASSET AI?

DASSET AI is the artificial intelligence engine that powers your personal and private AI.  It uses a hybrid AI approach, processing your personal data for AI queries locally while using the public cloud for processing non-sensitive data.  With DASSET AI, you can generate images, summarize documents and notes, and create a private library of data that never leaves your device.  For more information, see [DASSET AI](../concepts/dasset-ai.md).

### How does DASSET AI keep my data private?

When using DASSET AI, you have the ability to create private **Knowledge Bases** which contain data you choose, such as documents and photos.  When interacting with DASSET AI, you can specify the which Knowledge Base you wish to use, which is referenced when you execute your query.  The processing of your AI requests are all done locally on your DASSET Data Hub, or your PC, keeping the complete context of your AI interaction private.

### What is "dSoul"?

User behavior characteristic data learned from each interaction with the DASSET AI is stored in your dSoul (data Soul), on your DASSET Data Hub or your computer. Your dSoul automatically updates through Self-Learning and can be corrected by you at any time. Self-Learning extracts features from user knowledge and behavior data to form a digital representation of the user's soul.

### What devices can I use with a DASSET Data Hub?

DASSET is designed to be accessed from apps from your mobile devices (Android or iOS), or your computer (Windows and MacOS).
